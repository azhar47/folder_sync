A simple Python script that synchronizes a source folder with a replica folder, ensuring the replica matches the source. It performs periodic synchronization by copying new or updated files and deleting outdated ones.


To run in CMD:
python sync.py "<source_folder_path>" "<log_file_path>" <sync_interval_seconds>
